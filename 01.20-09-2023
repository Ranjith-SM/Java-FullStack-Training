Disk:
    hdd > less speed in read and write operations. contains mostly hardware. less cost.
    ssd > it is faster and better than hdd. cost is high.

Ram:
    Random Access Memory.
    stores a temporary value in memory for a faster Access.

Cached Memory:
    faster access to value than Ram.

Application process:
    when dev developed a new feature , they will build and deploy it in the cloud or server.

    when a client uses the Application , he/she will access the server to use the application , and there 
    will be a loadbalancer to avoid the cloud traffic. 

    the server will be connected to the metrics server/system to ensure that the server is performing the
    process.

tcp: transmission control protocol, it will use 3-way communication to transfer data.
        it is used in smtp and ftp.

udp: User datagram protocol, it will be faster than tcp.
        it is used in video call, audio call.

DNS: Domain Name system
        to get the server ip address from the server and get the straight domain name.
        cdn will be used to get the server ip address and get it to the client as fast as possible.
        cdn(Content Delivery Network) 

API : Application Programming Interface
    1.REST - use http 1
        1.get
        2.put
        3.post
        4.delete
    2.Graph - use http 1
    3.GRPC - use http 2


when we sent the data to the server it will be sent in packets, and it contains the ip address of the sender
and the client/server ip address. this will be called data packets.
